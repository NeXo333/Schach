## Introduction

Welcome to the Chess Game project! This chess game allows you to play offline
against your friends on a single device. While it's currently offline-only, 
future enhancements may include online multiplayer and AI opponents. Our goal was to create a 
well-structured and modularized project that can be easily extended in the future.



## Features

Here are some key features that make our chess game unique:

- **Ease of Use:** The game is designed to be simple and intuitive, 
making it accessible for players of all skill levels.

- **Modularized Movement Logic:** The movement logic is separated and easy to understand, 
allowing for future modifications and enhancements.

- **Move Highlights:** The game highlights possible moves to assist players, 
but this feature can also be turned off for those who prefer a more traditional 
board game experience.
